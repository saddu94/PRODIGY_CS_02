# PRODIGY_CS_02

This cybersecurity project was developed independently as part of an internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The project involved using various references and extensive self-study to complete the task.

## Description

The project focuses on image encryption and decryption using Python. The tool enables users to encrypt an image, save the encrypted version, and later decrypt it using a key.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You may also need additional libraries depending on the code requirements.

## How to Run

1. **Run the Code**
   ```sh
   python ./pixelmanipulation.py
   ```

2. **Image Encryption**
   - A new window will open.
   - Choose the image you want to encrypt.
   - Set the path where the encrypted image will be saved.
   - Add a key that should be memorized for decryption.

3. **Image Decryption**
   - Follow the same steps as encryption.
   - Use the same key that was used during the encryption process to decrypt the image.

## Notes

- The encryption key must be memorized as it is required for decryption.
- Ensure the paths provided for saving and accessing images are correct.
